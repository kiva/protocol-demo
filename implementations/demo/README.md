# Implementation for a cloud issuer/verifier controller for demo purposes

TODO there are a lot of refactors to come, such as:
 - Removing the depedency of the controller code on the data.service
 - Moving each of these controllers to the top level
 - Bringing in the common controller code via npm link
 - Moving more of the common bits between ncra, fsp, kiva, and demo into the base controller code
